    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Bayern Munich was founded by members of a Munich gymnastics club (MTV 1879).        
     When a congregation of members of MTV 1879 decided on 27 February 1900 that the footballers of
      the club would not be allowed to join the German Football Association (DFB),
      eleven members of the football division left the congregation and on the 
      same evening founded Fußball-Club Bayern München. Within a few months, Bayern achieved high-scoring victories
       against all local rivals, including a 15–0 win against Nordstern,
      [7] and reached the semi-finals of the 1900–01 South German championship.
     [4] In the following years, the club won some local trophies, and, in 1910–11, Bayern joined the newly founded "Kreisliga", the first regional Bavarian league.
     The club won this league in its first year, but did not win it again until the beginning of the First World War in 1914, which halted all football activities in Germany.
     [8][9] By the end of its first decade of founding,
      Bayern had its first German national team player, Max Gablonsky.[10]
     By 1920, it had over 700 members, making it the largest football club in Munich.[10]</p>

      <h2>The golden years (1960s–1970s)</h2>
      <p>In their first Bundesliga season, Bayern finished third and also won the DFB-Pokal.
     This qualified them for the following year's European Cup Winners' Cup, which they won in the final against Scottish club Rangers,
      Franz Roth scoring the decider in a 1–0 extra time victory.[17] In 1967, Bayern retained the DFB-Pokal,
     but slow overall progress saw Branko Zebec take over as coach. He replaced Bayern's offensive style of play with a more disciplined approach,
     and in doing so achieved the first league and cup double in Bundesliga history in 1969. Bayern Munich are one of four German clubs to
      win the Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal in the same season along with Borussia Dortmund, 1.
     FC Köln and Werder Bremen. Zebec used only 13 players throughout the season.[2</p>

      <h2>Renewed international success</h2>
      <p>After his success at Borussia Dortmund, Bayern were coached by Ottmar Hitzfeld from 1998 to 2004.
        In Hitzfeld's first season, Bayern won the Bundesliga and came close to winning the Champions League,
         losing 2–1 to Manchester United into injury time after leading for most of the match.
        [35] The following year, in the club's centenary season, Bayern won the third league and cup double in its history.
        A third consecutive Bundesliga title followed in 2001, won with a stoppage time goal on the final day of the league season.</p>
